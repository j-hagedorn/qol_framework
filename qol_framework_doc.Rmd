# Why we do what we do

This framework comes from a simple starting point: The intent of supports and services is to help each person to flourish, to achieve a better life.

This aligns with the MDHHS person-centered planning policy, which begins by stating that:^[MDHHS BHDDA Person-Centered Planning Policy (June 5, 2017), p. 1]

> *The purpose of the community mental health system is to support adults and children... to live successfully in their communities — achieving community inclusion and participation, independence, and productivity [and to] to identify and achieve their personal goals.*

# What do we mean by 'a better life'?

People have been asking themselves what it means to live a good life for thousands of years,^[The philosopher Aristotle defined the highest good of human life as happiness, or flourishing (*eudaimonia*).  cf. *Nicomachean Ethics*] and it is among the most crucial questions for each of us to answer.  Here, we will refer to the characteristics that make up a good life as *quality of life*, or QOL for short, relying primarily on research over the past century to arrive at a common and usable definition.

## What makes a good definition?

If we are going to try to define quality of life, it is important that our definition gets a few things right:^[These considerations are drawn from [Cummins, R. (2005). Moving from the quality of life concept to a theory. JIDR, 49(10), 699-706](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16162114).]

1. *Multiple dimensions*.  A good life can only be described using multiple dimensions. These are influenced by personal factors, environmental factors, and the interaction between those factors.
2. *Broad enough for everyone*.  We should want to apply the definition to our own lives, and so should others who are different than us.  The basic characteristics of a good life are the same for all people, regardless of culture, gender, disability, etc. 
3. *Both subjective and objective*. Different people have different priorities.  While we can point to objective facts related to QoL, it necessarily includes the point-of-view of the person who is living their life from day to day.  Note that each dimension of the QoL model may have objectively and subjectively defined indicators.

Taken together, these criteria seek to balance the abstract with the specific to arrive at a definition which is well-rounded and understandable.

## What makes a better life?

Keeping our key requirements in mind, we can draw from the broad reservoir of studies on QoL to find frameworks which are multi-dimensional^[See systematic review of HRQoL recommending addition of individual and environmental characteristics:  [Bakas, T., et al. (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3548743/).], cross-culturally relevant,^[See [Schalock, R., et al. (2005).](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mian_Wang4/publication/7801771_Cross-Cultural_Study_of_Quality_of_Life_Indicators/links/0deec52df448eac34d000000/Cross-Cultural-Study-of-Quality-of-Life-Indicators.pdf).] and which provide both subjective and objective indicators.

Below is a potential model listing essential dimensions of QoL:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

tribble(
  ~Area,                  ~Dimension,                ~`Example Indicators`,
  #--|--|----
  "Independence",         "Personal development",    "Education status, personal skills, ADLs, IADLs",
  "            ",         "Self-determination",      "Choices, autonomy, personal control, goals",
  "Social participation", "Interpersonal relations", "Social networks, activities, relationships",
  "                    ", "Social inclusion",        "Community integration, participation, roles",
  "                    ", "Rights",                  "Human (respect/dignity, equality), Legal",
  "Well-being",           "Emotional well-being",    "Safety, positive experiences, self-concept, stress",
  "          ",           "Physical well-being",     "Health, nutrition, recreation/physical exertion",
  "          ",           "Material well-being",     "Financial status, employment, housing, possessions"
) %>%
knitr::kable(caption = 'QoL Dimensions')

```

Please note that the framework listed above is one of many potential models, each of which contains many of the same basic dimensions, and many were developed with populations having specific conditions.  Some other broad-based models for review include:

- The [World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/77932/WHO_HIS_HSI_Rev.2012.03_eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) domains

# Benefits of a QoL Perspective

## What other frameworks exist?

One might ask: *Is quality of life the only potential framework that we could use to measure improvement?*, and the answer is *No*, so it is worth discussing other options and briefly reviewing the attributes of each.  Other options include:

- *Symptom reduction*: Measurement of reduction in symptoms related to specific diagnosable conditions.  Symptom scales such as the [PHQ-9](https://www.phqscreeners.com/sites/g/files/g10049256/f/201412/PHQ-9_English.pdf), [GAD-7]() and other tools have commonly been used to measure the impact of treatments on specific conditions, but they are more challenging to use for people with multiple co-occuring conditions (MCC).
- *Improving functional status*: Most currently used assessment tools address functional status, measuring the impact of various conditions on broader life areas in terms of their impact on functional ability.  These are broader than symptom scales, and can detect the impact of various symptoms on a particualr functional domain.
- *Health-related quality of life (HRQoL)*:  HRQoL addresses a subset of QoL domains which are related to perceived physical and mental health.  These models typically exclude non-medical areas such as education or rights, focusing on physical domains like 'mobility'. More recent evaluations have criticized this approach as failing to "sufficient emphasis on mental and social domains...that are essential to people."^[Read [Pietersma, S., et al. (2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4031380/) regarding domains of quality of life.]

## Why is a quality of life framework better than others?

A QoL approach has the following benefits over the approaches mentioned above:

**Strengths-based**:  A QoL approach asks people what they want their lives to be and encourages them to work toward that vision.  Rather than focusing on needs or deficits, it aspires to use a person's strengths to improve his or her life.^[See the MDHHS PCP Policy value that "The PCP approach identifies the person’s strengths, goals, choices... and desired outcomes." (p. 4)]

**Inclusive**: Instruments and measures from each of the other areas can be included as a part of the QoL framework, since it is broad enough to include each of these areas, and they each contribute to it.  For instance, if a person experiences an alleviation of their depressive symptoms using the PHQ-9, this would be seen as contributing toward the individual's QoL in the area of 'Emotional Well-being'.

**Contextual**: An approach which focuses on only a portion of an individual's life, such as mobility or anxiety symptoms, is likely to miss out on the bigger picture.  It may also inadvertently create siloes among the individuals supporting the person.  This broader contextual focus is aligned with our evolving understanding of several areas, each of which stresses the critical relationship between person and environment, and underscore the importance of a whole-person approach:

- *Social Determinants of Health* (SDoH): A vast and growing body of [research](https://www.cdc.gov/socialdeterminants/research/index.htm) indicates that the places and conditions in which we live are intrinsically tied to the quality of our lives and the likelihood of achieving positive outcomes from the supports and services we receive. 
- *Trauma-Informed Care*: More and more models for service provision, informed by research and by the lived experience of trauma survivors, are founded on the recognition that adverse events in our relationships and in our lived environment can have a profound and lifelong impact on our lives.^[For a recent review of these models, see: [Purtle, J. (2018). Trauma, Violence, & Abuse](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30079827).]
- *Supports Paradigm*: A model, prevalent in the IDD supports system, that views a person's functioning as the match between their individual capacity and the environment in which they are expected to live and work.^[See [Thompson, et al. (2009)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19368481) on conceptualizing support needs.]  In this model, supports are viewed as a way to supplement the persons strengths and to help match those to the person's environment.

# Person-Centered Everything

The collective effect of our needs and environments has a profound impact at the level of the population, but the primary catalyst for transformation is at the level of the individual person.  This is the profound insight of *person-centered planning* (PCP), which has formed the cornerstone of Michigan policy related to behavioral health services and supports.^[See the Michigan Mental Health Code, [Act 258 of 1974, Section 330.1712](http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?mcl-330-1712).] 

Despite the central position of PCP to the Medicaid services system in Michigan, in practice it has often been relegated to the planning meeting itself and the preparation for that meeting: ensuring inclusion of family and friends, personal involvement, etc.  While the act of planning remains a cornerstone of the process, it is only the first step of what is needed to truly achieve one's goals.^[Part of the focus on the meeting is due to the auditing focus on the plan document: an instance of *what is measured, is addressed*.]

## Person-Centered *Planning-Doing-Checking-Acting*

This broader scope is already recognized within the state's policy, which indicates that:^[MDHHS BHDDA Person-Centered Planning Policy (June 5, 2017), p. 1]

> *through PCP, a person is engaged in decision-making, problem solving, monitoring progress, and making needed adjustments to goals and supports and services provided in a timely manner.*

In order to determine the success of an individual plan of support, it is necessary to have a strategy to measure improvement in the person's desired areas of focus.  These measurement-based approaches have been gaining traction in their use across populations.^[[Shalock, et al. (2018)](https://aaidd.org/docs/default-source/sis-docs/changes-in-the-field.pdf?sfvrsn=cd8b3021_0) note "an increased emphasis on... conducting outcome evaluation... to assess the degree to which personal goals, positive changes, or benefits have been achieved" in IDD planning.]

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin = T, fig.cap="PDCA cycle", fig.fullwidth=F}

```

Framing the intent of supports and services as improving personal quality of life through person-centered planning also creates a natural bridge to using well-tested quality improvement processes at the individual level.  Perhaps the most applicable of these is the *Plan-Do-Check-Act* (PDCA) cycle, which involves each element of the broad scope of PCP defined above.  The PDCA cycle has already been successfully incorporated into the supports and treatment planning process for people with varying conditions and needs, from intellectual and developmental disabilities, to mental illness, to physical health concerns.

The table below illustrates the relationship between the PDCA process and a fuller definition of the PCP process:

# Impact on Current System

The framework outlined here attempts to align with and fulfill the promise of current definitions of person-centered planning, as well as with existing and evolving standards in the fields of behavioral health and developmental disability services.  Far from contradicting these standards, it attempts to provide a broader, person-centered context for the development of the system as a whole.

## Alignment with Federal Medicaid Requirements



## Alignment with Provider Requirements

*Clinically Feasible*: Multiple pragmatic trials have demonstrated that the use of symptom scales are both feasible to implement on a large scale^[See the large scale implementations cited in [Fortney, J. C., et al. (2016). A tipping point for measurement-based care. Psychiatric Services, 68(2), 179-188.](https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ps.201500439#T1).] and acceptable to people receiving services.^[[Dowrick, C., et al. (2009)](https://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b663.long) report that the use of instruments increase confidence in providers' accuracy and management.]

*Provider Accreditation*: New standards for Joint Commission accreditation (effective 2018)^[See Joint Commission [*Standard CTS.03.01.09*, sections *EP1-3*](https://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/6/Approved_BHC_outcome_meas_2018.pdf).] require that an organization (a) "uses a standardized tool or instrument to monitor individuals progress in achieving... goals", (b) "gathers and analyzes data generated through standardized monitoring, and results used to inform goals and objectives of individual's plan", and (c) "evaluates outcomes of... services... by aggregating and analyzing data collected through the standardized monitoring effort."

*Diagnostic Practice*: The most recent diagnostic manual (DSM-5) includes [assessment measures](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures) which were "developed to be administered at the initial patient interview and to monitor treatment progress."
