Planning process
– timeliness and frequency: our person centered plans to seeing compete completed on time and at least annually?– - - Tailored to knees: is that the person centered planning process taking the individual needs into account in the development of the plan?
– Personal experience of process: how did the individual experience the process, along very yes domains, such as engagement, inclusion, etc.
– Documentation of plan: is the plan written and that person first language? Is it written and now a natural manner, using the individuals on words? Is it contain concrete goals for implementation?

Implementation of plan
– services provided according to plan: our services provided in a way that is sufficient to meet the goals provided and document it in the individual plan?
– flexibility of plan: does plan change according to the needs of the individual throughout the year, or is it updated annually and does it remain primarily the same?

Conduct a brief literature review of (A) existing quality measures reviewed by NQF and other national entities related to personal and family centered services, (B) survey tools and other instruments to measure individuals perception of person centered planning process

This review would include an updated download of CMS quality metrics as well as measures included in the person centered domain of NQF.

The world didn’t start yesterday:
Frame both the review of. Existing metrics and the review of federal policy and development of a search strategy as the initial step to frame the context and need for a more thorough quality of life system.

The quality of life framework should encompass not only the process of developing a plan but the implementation of that plan (system following up on its obligations), and the outcome of those services on an individual’s quality of life (this may include quality-of-life measures but will also need to address functional improvement and symptoms, especially aware of those are the only data sets available). The simplest sketch of the framework could be set up to define:
(A) characteristics or domains of quality-of-life, and
(B) phases or points in the planning and treatment process which address these.

——-
Measures are about accountability as well as understanding. Thus, they should reflect the obligations of the service provider system at each point of engagement. They should also be reasonable; putting forth expectations which a person could reasonably expect to see happen.

Thus, in addition to the quality of life domains which will be present across the different phases of a persons relationship with the system, there will also be access, timeliness, and process measures, And these will be a greater proportion of the measures at the outset of services.

Our obligation to a person increases as our time with them lengthens.

For instance, at the beginning or initial encounter with the system, a person can expect timeliness, ease of access, and friendly, person centered staff. It may not, however, be reasonable to expect significant changes in functioning or symptom reduction, and especially not in higher level constructs such as quality of life.  

Beyond this initial phase, the system obligation broadens, and expands to be obligated to bring to bear the greatest advancements in knowledge regarding best practices and to apply those in a way which is tailored to the individual person and improves both functioning, where possible, and quality of life.

Because of the complexity of the challenges and circumstances which individuals face, this is by no means a straightforward task. Any target is filled as much with hope as it is with obligation. Yet if we do not challenge ourselves to hope, we will never achieve.
Thus, it is crucial that some metrics be reported, but that targets not be required or tied to payment. If they are tied, it would be for a reward based on innovation and performance beyond baseline expectations

# Policy Level
There has been increasing recognition that financial indicators are not sufficient to depict the success of countries and communities.

# Metric Dev

Note that we are not proposing specific metrics here, merely identifying the existing data which could be used (in various ways) to identify current practices and outcomes.

# Person-focused

The language of 'person-centered' has sometimes prompted people to imagine individuals as mere 'consumers', recipients of help rather than active and valuable members of their communities.  If we limit our view of individual choice to what services can be purchased, we limit our view of people (including ourselves) to that of 'consumers.'  A personal focus seeks to find not only who and what is important to the person, but who and what *find the person important*. What does this person offer that no one else can?
