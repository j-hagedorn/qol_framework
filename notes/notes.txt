# Person-focused

The language of 'person-centered' has sometimes prompted people to imagine individuals as mere 'consumers', recipients of help rather than active and valuable members of their communities.  If we limit our view of individual choice to what services can be purchased, we limit our view of people (including ourselves) to that of 'consumers.'  A personal focus seeks to find not only who and what is important to the person, but who and what *find the person important*. What does this person offer that no one else can?
